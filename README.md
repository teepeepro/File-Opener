A basic app created for a client to simplify the redundant task of opening most recent PDF blueprint files on network server

While working at a large firm setting up broadcasting technologies for over 40 venues for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, I came across the need to simply the redudant task of opening the most recent iteration of blueprint PDF drawings that we used on a day to day basis. Normally, this would involve connecting to a network drive, clicking about 10 times (as drive was not indexed for internal searching) and choosing the most up to date file to view, print or email to outside organization stakeholders. Thus, I created my first python application and GUI application to simplify this process for my collegues and I. 

This python code serves as an example of simplifying a basic user process.

The initial dictionary contains the strings of what the final folder is called, so absolutely modify them as necessary, if you use this code.
